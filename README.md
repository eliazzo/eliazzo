## Hi there 👋 My name is Elisabeth (she/her/they) and I am an aspiring software developer. 

### I graduated in July 2022 from the University of Manchester with a BA in Linguistics and Spanish. 

### I have just started Founders and Coder's Skills Bootcamp and am looking to secure a software development apprenticeship over the next few months. My interests outside of coding include but are not limited to

- Yoga ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a qualified yoga instructor 🧘
- Travel
- Languages (I speak Spanish and a goal of mine is to learn French)
- Food 🌶️ 🍤 🍋 🍜 🥐 🥑 (Cooking AND eating)


🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamental skills of software development. Check out [my profile](https://github.com/eliazzo) to follow my learning journey!
