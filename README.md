<h1 align="center">Hi there👋</h1>
<br>


- 🌱 I’m currently working as a Software Developer and Course Facilitator at [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/). We provide tuition-free, peer-led coding bootcamps to help people from all backgrounds get into tech and make a social impact.
  
- 🦠 My role involves designing and enhancing internal platforms and learning materials for staff and students using technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and SQL.

- 🎓 I specialised in Linguistics at university and went on to teach English Language GCSE and work with SEN and EAL students at secondary school level. I was previously a student of the Founders and Coders immersive developer programme where I trained to become a full-stack software engineer.
 
- 👩‍💻 I am highly collaborative and familiar with Agile practices. The projects listed below demonstrate some of the technical areas I have covered so far...
