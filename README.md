<h1 align="center">Hi there👋</h1>
<br>
<h2 align="center">My name is Elisabeth (she/her/they/them) and I am a junior software developer</h2>
<br>


- 🎓 I graduated in July 2022 from the **University of Manchester** with a first class degree in Linguistics and Spanish (Hons).

- 🌱 I’m a current student of the **Founders and Coders skills bootcamp** and looking to secure a software development apprenticeship.

- 🏛️ I have strong foundations in **HTML**, vanilla **JavaScript** and **CSS** that I am combining with new learnings on a daily basis as I progress through the course. I recently completed a module in **asynchronous JavaScript** and am currently learning about **testing**.

- 📓 Check my learning journey in this [portfolio](https://github.com/fac27/eliazzo-portfolio) which features up to date reflections on the modules covered on the course.
